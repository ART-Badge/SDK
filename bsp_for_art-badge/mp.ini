;
; The following four sections are mandatory: BinID, Version, PartNumber and DataLength. Among
; which the DataLength key is not really needed to write in this file, as it would be calculated
; by the prepend_header tool and automatically filled in the MP header.

; written and ensure they are not out of bound of the header.
